# NavigationStack-App

In this tutorial, instead of the classic accent color in SwiftUI, there is a customized accent color, which allows us to use the Navigation title color in a color other than white or black. We also prevent problems that may occur due to NavigationView on the iPad by using NavigationStack. 

The application can be developed and contribute to your projects.
